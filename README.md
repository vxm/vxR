# vxR
vxR is a non real time render engine based on grid acceleration structure.

History:

 The idea is to create a personal proyect to learn to program better. I finished a starting point of this render 10 years ago. I did this to learn to develop using templates and c++ in general. 
 
Present:

 short term
  Design for later threads.
  C++11 and C++14 practicing.

 long term
  Better renders, better program interface.
 
Future:

 std::threads
 
 Further opitmizations.
 
 GPU
