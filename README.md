# vxR
vxR is a non real time render engine based on grid acceleration structure.

History:

 A little bit of history is needed to understand the scope of this project. It all started in 2002, I was tasked to investigate and develop subsurface scattering in a shader network which didn't gave me enough access to render data, so I was unable to calculate it. It was this frustrated project that pushed me, or invited me, to create my own render engine.

 This project, has served me as a studying platform to learn c++ 17 and maths.
 
 In the past years, while I was working on VFX companies, I've seen colleages develop in-house render engines and they were driven by efficiency and innovation, which is a complete different path of development of this personal render engine.
 
Present:

 short term:
 
  Design for later threads.
  C++11 and C++14 practicing.

 long term:
 
  Better renders, better program interface.
 
Future:

 std::threads
 
 Further opitmizations.
 
 GPU
