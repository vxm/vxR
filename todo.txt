TODO:

- Rework getNearestCollision for optimization.
	* investigate plane values for ray traveling.
	* do x, y and z, not only z
	* find dominant axis in ray
	* complete block visualization, and create a tag version.
	* LAST execute with valgrind again.

- Shaders:
	* Lumminance + shaders, rework.
	- create standard shader
	  - provide simple shading
		* angular shading
	  - decouple lambert shader with texture
	  - shadows.
		- Raytrace shadows.  
	- multiple lights
	- Ingelligent subsampling.
	- Global illumination.
	- Subsurface scattering.

- Camera:
	- Rework subsamples.

- General
	* Better statistics, c++11 chrono.
	* Deploy time over processes.
	
- BUGS:
  - Get rid of black lines in render.
    - swap image resolution to aperture for ray generation.
  * Get rid of OLD warnings, to 0.
  
- Improvements
  - Improve memory usage for vxGrid.
  - Volumes.
  - Profiling:
    - Get rid of; tangent operations. or cache them.

- General raytracing, and not only from camera.
	- investigate pointer advance patern for traveling rays.
