- Rework getNearestCollision for optimization.
  * investigate plane values for ray traveling.
  - do x, y and z, not only z
  - complete block visualization, and create a tag version.
  - LAST execute with valgrind again.

- Lumminance + shaders, rework.
- Shadows.
  - Raytrace shadows.

- Get rid of black lines in render.
  - swap image resolution to aperture for ray generation.
 
* Get rid of OLD warnings, to 0.

- Improve memory usage for vxGrid.

- General raytracing, and not only from camera.
	- investigate pointer advance patern for traveling rays.

  - Get rid of; tangent operations. or cache them.

- Global illumination.
